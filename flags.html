                    <h3>First Flag</h3>
                    <p>This flag was inspired by the dominance of the chicken in on the landscape of Honolulu. I tried
                        to incorporate the traditional colours of Hawaii into the flag, as well as trying to evoke an
                        emotion from the viewer, specifically the all too familiar feeling of waking up at the crack of
                        dawn to chickens screaming. The silhouette of the chicken against the sun is an unfortunate
                        reminder to everyone residing in urban Honolulu as to whom the true master of our city is.</p>

                        <h3>Second Flag</h3>
                        <p>This second flag takes the concepts of the first one and simply moves it into a new design
                            direction. I split the green and red colours diagonally across the flag's surface, and then
                            used the sun as a background for the chicken's head. The four stars are indicative of the
                            four counties of Hawai'i, with Honolulu being arguably the most important. Again, the
                            chicken is figured prominently, being the overlord of the entire state, completely
                            unimpeachable in it's dominance of the islands. </p>

                        <p>Crete is an island off of Greece located in the Mediterranean sea, known to be the most
                            populous of the many isles dotting the area. An ancient place, Crete was an established
                            kingdom thousands of years before the modern age, and has a deep and rich history that has
                            inspired myths and other tales throughout ancient times. Now the island is a popular tourist
                            destination known for its beautiful landscapes and beaches, as well as the ruins dotting its
                            landscape that contain many examples of Minoan art.

                        <h3>Thought Process</h3>
                        <p>Although Crete is well known, I have not seen a tourist logo that I felt inspired anyone to
                            visit it. I wanted to incorporate both the landscape and Creteâ€™s history into one image that
                            I felt could evoke an emotion. I wanted a simple image that would inspire a feeling of
                            beauty, but also severity using a bold typeface that demands attention. One of the
                            challenges was colour, as I felt that blues and greens were not evocative of the tranquility
                            I was seeking, and opted instead to choose the colour of the setting sun against the beach
                            and water, as well as the column.</p>
