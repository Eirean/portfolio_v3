                        <p>Embarking on the journey of designing a magazine layout dedicated to the illustrious
                            artist Albrecht Dürer was both exhilarating and challenging. Dürer's contributions to art,
                            spanning the
                            Renaissance period, are profound and multifaceted, presenting a plethora of creative
                            opportunities and
                            design considerations. This project aimed to encapsulate Dürer's legacy while infusing
                            modern
                            design
                            elements to captivate contemporary audiences.</p>

                        <h3>First Spread &amp; Thoughts</h3>
                        <p>This spread was conceived after mulitiple other examples of magazine spreads were completed.
                            The previous spreads were "safe"; that is more scholarly in style, whilst the two featured
                            on this page were envisioned to be featured in a history magazine such as "National
                            Geographic" or another publication in that style. I chose to highlight the ant over the
                            background, as I felt that that was the most important aspect of the picture. I used orange
                            in the headers to draw the attention of the reader whist not being overly distracting from
                            the images themselves. I used a stylised drop cap on the article to evoke a feeling of the
                            time period on the reader, and inserted the illustration within the text so that the reader
                            would not have move their eyes off the text to view it.</p>

                <div class="magazine row big-space-above swapped">

                        <img src="images/durer_1.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="10000" height="10000">
                    </div>
                    <div class="one-third">
                        <h3>Second Spread &amp; Thoughts</h3>
                        <p>This spread is an extension of the first spread, but with larger graphics. I opted for a full
                            page spread of the clasping hands in order to draw the reader's attention to the article.
                            The drop cap in the body copy is much more traditional, reflecting the more scholarly and
                            less stylised aspect of this design. Again, an orange colour was used, mainly to draw
                            attention without being too obtrusive. This time I relegated the body copy to the left and
                            gave almost equal space to the image on the right in order to keep white space on both the
                            top and bottom of the page.</p>
